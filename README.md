### Clone this repo/project 

If you want to experiment with running this project, you'll need to [clone](https://github.com/avicek0/demoguru99AutomationProjectUsingJs-Cucumber.git) it first.

To clone this project in `Github`, run these commands in Gitbash:

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory

## Documentation of Output of All Test Cases that were performed in this project
***

### Test Case 1: Login Failure
---

  'Before' is executed here and the first test case starts.
    
  Success: 
+ All the required values are posted with status code '200'
    
Error: 

+ (uncaught exception)ReferenceError: validateLogin is not defined.


This error is handled inside commands.js file : cypress -> supports -> commands.js


``` js
           Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
             // returning false here prevents Cypress from
             // failing the test
              return false
             })

```

---
### Test Case 2: Register User
---


Success: 

+ All the required values are posted with status code '200' 
+ Used assetions returns true values.

Error:

+ (uncaught exception)ReferenceError: validateReg is not defined.  
     



This error is handled inside commands.js file : cypress -> supports -> commands.js
        
``` js

           Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
             // returning false here prevents Cypress from
             // failing the test
              return false
             })
          
```
       
---
### Test Case 3: Login Succeed
---
Success:
+ All the required values are posted with status code '200' and user is redirected to new page.

Error:
+ Not any.
       

---
### Test Case 4: Request Quotation
---
  

Success :

- All the required values are posted with status code '200' 
- Used assetions returns true values. 
- User gets back to the home page.


Error:

+ Not any.

---
### Test Case 5: Retrieve Quotation
---


Success : 

+ All the required values are posted with status code '200'
+ Random number is paseted on 'Unique Identification Number Field' successfully.

Error : 
+ Not Any.

+ Since we have used Random Number to retrieve quotation, we will get 'Wrong Quotation Id' in the browser and it will not halt the system and won't print error in the console. So basically it is not an error.

---
### Test Case 6: Open Profile
---
Success :

+ Profile page just opens, since we have just performed click() operation on locators of Profile tab.

Error : 
+ Not Any.

---
### Test Case 7: Edit profile
---
Success :  

- All the required values are posted with status code '200' 
- Used assetions returns true values. 

Error: 
+ Not Any.
                            
'After' gets executed here when the last test case finishes.

Now we will be logged out to where we started and we will know that our test cases are successfully tested.
